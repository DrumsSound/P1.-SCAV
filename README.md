Guide:


Once you run the program you can choose between these different actions: 

      1. RGB and YUV translator
      2. Image resize
      3. Convert to b/w
      4. Run-length encoding
      5. DCT convertor
      exit. To end the program
       

 Now you can navigate throught the program.
 

 1. First option allows translate 3 values on RGB to YUV, or the reverse.
    	The program will ask you:
          - Enter 1 if you want to Translate RGB to YUV
          - Enter 0 if you want to Translate YUV to RGB

	And then it will ask for your 3 values

 
 2. Second option allows you to resize an image.
     	The program will ask you to enter:
	- width
	- height
     of the output image resized.    

 
 3. Third option allows to convert and image to a black and white version of it. Also aplying some compression.
	The program will ask you to enter the amount of compression:
	- Enter your compression level (between 1 and 100)

         
 4. Fourth option allows you to run a length encoder in a series of bits.
		(the array of bits is setted by default)


 5. Fifth option allows you to run DCT on a default array of values.
	The program converts to DCT, and then also decodes obtaining the same original array.


 exit. Finally if you want a close the program just type the word exit.
